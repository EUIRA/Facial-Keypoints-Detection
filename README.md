# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

This project deals with technologies that are the basis of modern computer vision. Using the OpenCV library, it finds a human face in an image. In addition, hand-made CNN models can extract keypoints from the face found. For example, eyes, nose, lips, wrinkles, and facial contours. This technology can be applied to a truly vast field. It should be noted that the existence of machine learning is for humanity, so privacy should always be considered important. Also, I hope you don't download files to submit your personal homework.

The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks, **only Notebooks 2 and 3 (and the `models.py` file) will be graded**:

__Notebook 1__ : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

__Notebook 2__ : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

__Notebook 3__ : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN

__Notebook 4__ : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
